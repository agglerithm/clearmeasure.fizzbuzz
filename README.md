Coding test for Clear  Measure

The console app will prompt you for the word to use for the first number ("fizz" by default), and the word for the second number ("buzz" by default).
It will also prompt you for values to substitute for the defaults, 3 and 5. 
Finally, it will prompt you for the upper bound (100 by default).
